# Claude Sandbox (Fedora 44 / OpenShell)

## What This Is

A reproducible, network-isolated development sandbox — built as an NVIDIA OpenShell sandbox from a Fedora 44 image — for running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safely. The sandbox bundles a Go toolchain and the claude-engineering-toolkit plugins, applies supply-chain cooldown pinning to its dependencies, and mounts `~/claudeshared` read-write so the operator can clone repos there and do development with Claude inside the sandbox. It is for a developer who wants to give Claude elevated, autonomous permissions without exposing the host or the open internet.

## Core Value

Claude can run fully autonomous (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) inside a sandbox that has **zero direct network egress** — all model inference is brokered through the OpenShell gateway — so elevated permissions can't be used to reach or exfiltrate to the open internet.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped and confirmed valuable. -->

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] Sandbox image is built with podman (`podman build`) from a Fedora 44 base, then run as an OpenShell sandbox (`openshell sandbox create --from <image-ref>`)
- [ ] All RPM updates applied during build (`dnf update -y`)
- [ ] Go toolchain installed via RPM (`golang`)
- [ ] golangci-lint installed via RPM
- [ ] govulncheck installed via `go install`, pinned to the latest version as of the cooldown date
- [ ] gsd-core installed, pinned to the latest version as of the cooldown date, with the same cooldown pinning extended to all of its dependencies
- [ ] Claude Code CLI installed, pinned to the latest version as of the cooldown date
- [ ] claude-engineering-toolkit fork cloned (`https://github.com/pheckenlWork/claude-engineering-toolkit.git`, default branch, latest HEAD)
- [ ] Claude launched with `--plugin-dir` pointed at the cloned toolkit so its agents and skills are available
- [ ] Claude launched with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- [ ] Sandbox runtime has zero direct internet egress; model inference is brokered via the OpenShell gateway
- [ ] `~/claudeshared` mounted read-write into the sandbox for cloning and developing repos
- [ ] A script rebuilds the sandbox on demand (re-applies the rolling cooldown each run)
- [ ] Cooldown is a rolling window: each rebuild pins to "latest as of 4 days before build"

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Cooldown pinning for the claude-engineering-toolkit — operator maintains the fork, so latest HEAD is trusted
- Direct internet egress from the running sandbox (including a direct allowlist to api.anthropic.com) — inference goes through the gateway instead; preserves zero-egress guarantee
- GPU allocation — not required for this workload unless surfaced later
- Multi-user / shared-host hardening beyond the single operator — single-developer tool

## Context

- **Host:** macOS (darwin), with `openshell` + `openshell-gateway` (`/opt/homebrew/bin`), `podman`, `docker` (Rancher Desktop), `nerdctl`, Node v26 / npm 11 already installed.
- **OpenShell model:** `sandbox create --from <Dockerfile|dir|image>` accepts a Dockerfile/dir (built via the local Docker daemon) **or a full image reference**. This project builds the image with `podman build` and passes the resulting image reference to `--from`, avoiding the Docker daemon. OpenShell sandboxes are themselves Podman-backed at runtime; the build-phase plan must confirm the podman-built image is visible to OpenShell (separate docker/podman image stores). Network egress is governed by a sandbox **policy** (endpoint allowlist, e.g. `policy update --add-endpoint host:port:...`); a deny/empty policy yields zero egress. The gateway provides `inference` brokering, which is how Claude reaches a model without direct egress.
- **Build vs runtime networking:** the podman build phase has network (needed for `dnf update`, `go install`, npm install, git clone); the zero-egress requirement applies to the *running* sandbox via policy.
- **`~/claudeshared`** already exists on the host and is the shared workspace for cloned repos.
- **Supply-chain intent:** pin third-party packages to versions that existed before a cooldown window (default 4 days) to avoid pulling freshly published (potentially malicious) releases.

## Constraints

- **Platform**: Sandbox runtime must be NVIDIA OpenShell — built/managed via the `openshell` CLI on this host.
- **Build tool**: Container image must be built with podman (`podman build`), not the Docker daemon. The image reference is then handed to `openshell sandbox create --from <image-ref>`.
- **Base image**: Fedora 44 — base for the sandbox image.
- **Network**: Running sandbox must have zero direct internet egress; inference via OpenShell gateway only.
- **Supply chain**: govulncheck, gsd-core (+ all deps), and Claude Code CLI pinned to "latest as of 4 days before build" (rolling). Cooldown window default 4 days.
- **Install methods**: Go and golangci-lint via RPM; govulncheck via `go install`; gsd-core + Claude Code via their package managers (npm).
- **Reproducibility**: rebuild must be script-driven and repeatable.

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Run as an OpenShell sandbox built from a Fedora 44 Dockerfile | "nvidia openshell" resolves to the installed OpenShell CLI, which builds from a Dockerfile/dir and runs as a sandbox | — Pending |
| Build the image with podman, hand the image reference to `openshell sandbox create --from <image-ref>` | Operator prefers podman over the Docker daemon for image builds; OpenShell `--from` accepts a full image reference | — Pending (build phase must confirm OpenShell picks up the podman-built image across separate image stores) |
| Inference brokered through the OpenShell gateway rather than allowlisting api.anthropic.com | Preserves true zero-egress for the sandbox while still letting Claude reach a model | — Pending |
| Authenticate via the Claude subscription login (gateway `claude-code` provider, `--from-existing`) instead of an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Host is already logged in via subscription (no API key present); gateway holds/refreshes the credential host-side, so the zero-egress sandbox needs only a placeholder | — Pending (inference phase to confirm exact provider create/inference set flags) |
| Rolling cooldown (build date − 4 days), window configurable | Keeps a constant supply-chain cooldown gap across periodic rebuilds | — Pending |
| Cooldown applies to govulncheck, gsd-core (+deps), and Claude Code CLI | Consistent supply-chain mitigation for network-installed components | — Pending |
| claude-engineering-toolkit cloned at latest HEAD (no cooldown) | Operator maintains the fork, so it's trusted | — Pending |
| Network needed at build time, zero egress enforced only at runtime | dnf/go/npm/git need network to build; policy enforces isolation when running | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
